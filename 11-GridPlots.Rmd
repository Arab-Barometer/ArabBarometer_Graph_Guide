# BARE BONES: Comparative Grid Plots


At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 11.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

plot_grid_comp(survey1,
               "Q700B")

```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 11.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}

plot_grid_comp(survey1,
               "Q700B")

```

Let's go!
