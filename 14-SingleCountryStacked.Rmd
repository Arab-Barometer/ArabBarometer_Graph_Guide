# BARE BONES: Single Country Stacked Plots


At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 14.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

plot_stacked_general(survey1,
                     "Algeria",
                     Q2061A,
                     Q609,
                     .title = "Most pressing concern in Algeria by religiosity",
                     .subtitle = "% saying",
                     .caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")

```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 14.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}

plot_stacked_general(survey1,
                     "Algeria",
                     Q2061A,
                     Q609,
                     .title = "Most pressing concern in Algeria by religiosity",
                     .subtitle = "% saying",
                     .caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")

```

Let's go!
