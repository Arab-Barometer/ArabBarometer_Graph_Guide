This guide does not cover everything the ArabBarometR package can do, particularly with respect to cleaning data. For a more extensive guide, please visit the general ArabBarometer Guide. This guide was created using the bookdown package, which comes with many fun and useful features. An overview of these features can be found in the Guide Features section in the general ArabBarometR Guide. As such, this guide assumes a few things: That you have the ArabBarometR package installed on your machine. If this is not true, please take a look at this chapter in the general ArabBarometR Guide. You have a basic understanding of how to load data and packages in R. If this is not true, you can pursue either this guide or this website. General Guide Process Assuming we are working with clean data, the graphs are created in two steps: Create a summary of the data you want to graph. Graph that summary. For each type of graph, the guide will first go through how to create one graph, then how to create many graphs. Example Data The examples in this guide will be created using data from Wave VI. For single survey graphs, it will use data from from Wave VI, Survey I. For trend graphs, it will use data from Wave VI, Survey I, II, and III, where Survey III is the final survey we conducted in Wave VI. The Wave VI data can be found on the Arab Barometer Github or the Arab Barometer website. Header Code The code examples in this guide will only focus on how to create graphs. It assumes your R file begins with the following code: setwd(&quot;/Path/to/Folder/with/Data&quot;) library(ArabBarometR) survey1 &lt;- haven::read.dta(&quot;Wave6Survey1.dta&quot;) survey2 &lt;- haven::read.dta(&quot;Wave6Survey2.dta&quot;) survey3 &lt;- haven::read.dta(&quot;Wave6Survey3.dta&quot;) In this code example “/Path/to/Folder/with/Data” is the path to where you are saving your work that also contains your data. This is best practice. For more on folders/working directories, see Section 1.1.2 in the general Arab Barometer Guide. Wave6SurveyX.dta in the above code example is a placeholder for whatever you have named the survey data for Surveys I, II, and III from Wave VI. If you read in the data (using the haven::read.dta() function) and save it as survey1, survey2, and survey3, you should be able to copy and paste the code in this guide exactly as is and run it in your own R session. This guide does not go over how to clean the data. For more on how to use the ArabBarometR package to clean Arab Barometer data, please see Chapter 5 Preparing the Data in the general ArabBarometR Guide. "],["single-country-overall-graphs.html", "Chapter 1 Single Country Overall Graphs 1.1 Create a Single Graph", " Chapter 1 Single Country Overall Graphs This chapter will cover how to make an overall frequency graph for a single country. 1.1 Create a Single Graph This section will go over how to make a one-off frequency graph for a single country. At the end, your code will look like the following: survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;) %&gt;% plot_smry_individual(.caption = &quot;Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria&quot;) That code will produce the following graph: Let’s go! 1.1.1 Create a Summary The first step in creating a plot is to gather the data you want to display and organize it. You do this with the create_smry_individual() function. You can learn more about this function in section 6.1 in the larger ArabBarometR guide. The three main parameters you need to provide to this function are (1) the data you are using, (2) the variable you want to plot, and (3) the country you want to plot it for. To see all the input parameters for the function, type the code ?calculate_smry_individual in your R console. In this example, the variable we want to plot is Q1COVID19 and the country we want to plot it for is Algeria. calculate_smry_individual( .data = survey1, # The data you are using .var = &quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, # The variable you want to plot .country = &quot;Algeria&quot; # The country you want to plot it for ) The above is the same as: calculate_smry_individual(survey1,&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;,&quot;Algeria&quot;) Which is the same as: survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;) The last example uses a pipe, %&gt;%, which comes from the package dplyr, which is automatically loaded by ArabBarometR. To learn more about piping and using %&gt;% in programming, see A Note on Piping in the larger ArabBarometR guide. The output of any of the above expressions is the same: ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Q1COVID19 Percent ## &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 [Very concerned] 28 ## 2 2 [Somewhat concerned] 44 ## 3 3 [Somewhat not concerned] 8 ## 4 4 [Not at all concerned] 20 ## 5 666 [Don&#39;t know/Refuse] 0 This data frame is what we are ultimately graphing. There are few things to note about the summary data frame we just created. First, there are two columns. The first column is named for the question we are graphing. The second column is named Percent. If you want to use the plotting functions in ArabBarometR to graph a summary data frame that is not created by a calculate function (see complete list of calculate functions in the ArabBarometR Guide), the data frame must be structured as two columns with the second column named Percent. Second, you can see that the first column is labeled. The labels come from the responses in the data. If the responses in the data are not labeled, this column will not be labeled. In the next step, plotting, the y-axis labels are taken from these labels. So, if the column is not labeled, the y-axis will just be the values of the column. Let’s store the summary as an object and move one. Q1COVID19_summary &lt;- survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;) 1.1.2 Plot the Summary The next step is plot the summary we just created. To do this, we use the function plot_smry_individual(). You can learn more about this function in section 7.1 of the ArabBarometR Guide. There is only one necessary parameter to use plot_smry_individual(): the summary data frame. For a complete list of acceptable parameters and documentation, you can run ?plot_smry_individual in your R console. Now, we can plug our summary into the plot function: plot_smry_individual( .df = Q1COVID19_summary # The summary data frame ) The above code is the same as: Q1COVID19_summary %&gt;% plot_smry_individual() Which is the SAME as: survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;) %&gt;% plot_smry_individual() We can do this because Q1COVID19_summary is equal to survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(\"Q1COVID19\", \"Algeria\"). Any of the above code gives the following graph: Almost done! Notice how the caption says Arab Barometer Wave N (DATE)? Let’s change that. survey1 %&gt;% calculate_smry_individual(&quot;Q1COVID19&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;) %&gt;% plot_smry_individual( .caption = &quot;Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria&quot; # NEW caption ) Now we have the plot we started with! We’re done!
