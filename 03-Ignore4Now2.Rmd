# Coming Soon: Comparative Overall Graphs

This chapter will cover how to make a comparative frequency graph for multiple countries.

## Create a Single Graph

This section will go over how to make a one-off comparative frequency graph for a multiple countries.

At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 03.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

survey1 %>%
  calculate_smry_comp("Q1COVID19") %>%
  plot_smry_comp(.caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")


```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 03.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}


survey1 %>%
  calculate_smry_comp("Q1COVID19") %>%
  plot_smry_comp(.caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")

```
