# Using a `map()` {#using-map -}

Quite often in coding, you want to do the same thing only slightly differently many times. For example, make a graph for every variable in a data set.

The package `purrr` is full of functions designed to help you do just that.

In particular, the `map()` function is extremely handy. It is used in all examples related to making multiple graphs.

The map function takes two inputs: (1) a list of things to pass to a function, and (2) a function. Essentially, **map** takes each item in the list, and passes it to the function very efficiently.
