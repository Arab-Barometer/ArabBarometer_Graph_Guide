# Single Country Overall Graphs

This chapter will cover how to make an overall frequency graph for a single country.

## Create a Single Graph

This section will go over how to make a one-off frequency graph for a single country.

At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 01.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

survey1 %>%
  calculate_smry_individual("Q1COVID19",
                            .country = "Algeria") %>%
  plot_smry_individual(.caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")


```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 01.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}

survey1 %>%
  calculate_smry_individual("Q1COVID19",
                            .country = "Algeria") %>%
  plot_smry_individual(.country = "Algeria",
                       .caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I")


```
