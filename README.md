### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the [latest version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown).

- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)

## Graphing Guide README

This guide focuses only on how to use the ArabBarometR package to make graphs. It does not cover everything the ArabBarometR package can do. To see more of the functions available in ArabBarometR, please visit [this website](https://arab-barometer.github.io/ArabBarometR-Guide/). This guide also assumes so familiarity with R and does not go over R fundamentals.
