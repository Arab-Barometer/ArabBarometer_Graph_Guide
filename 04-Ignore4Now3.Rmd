# Coming Soon: Comparative Demographic Graphs

This chapter will cover how to make a comparative frequency graph by demographic for multiple countries.

## Create a Single Graph

This section will go over how to make a one-off comparative frequency graph by demographic for a multiple countries.

At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 04.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

survey1 %>%
  calculate_demographic_smry_comp("Q1COVID19",
                                  .dem = "gender") %>%
  plot_demographic_smry_comp(.caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")


```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 04.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}


survey1 %>%
  calculate_demographic_smry_comp("Q1COVID19",
                                  .dem = "gender") %>%
  plot_demographic_smry_comp(.caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey I, Algeria")


```
