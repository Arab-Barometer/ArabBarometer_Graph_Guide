# COMING SOON: Comparative Multi-Question Plots


At the end, your code will look like the following:

```{r 10.1-Complete-Code-Example, eval=FALSE}

questions_2_compare <- list("Q210",
                            "Q211")
questions_labels <- c("Is there corruption?",
                      "Is the gov't cracking down?")

plot_multiquestions_comp(survey1,
                        questions_2_compare,
                        questions_labels,
                        .title = "Perceptions of Corruption in MENA",
                        .subtitle = "% saying to a medium or large extent",
                        .caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey 1")

```

That code will produce the following graph:


```{r 10.2-Complete-Graph-Example, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(13,12)}

questions_2_compare <- list("Q210",
                            "Q211")
questions_labels <- c("Is there corruption?",
                      "Is the gov't cracking down?")

plot_multiquestions_comp(survey1,
                        questions_2_compare,
                        questions_labels,
                        .title = "Perceptions of Corruption in MENA",
                        .subtitle = "% saying to a medium or large extent",
                        .caption = "Arab Barometer Wave VI, Survey 1")
```

Let's go!
